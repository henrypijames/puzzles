## Ackknowledgement
This is the very first puzzle I've created. I'm immensely grateful to [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrackingTheCryptic) and [Logic Master Germany](https://logic-masters.de/) for leading me into the world of variant sudoku; to all the people in this wonderful community who have encouraged me to dip my toes into puzzle creation; and most importantly, to _@Raumplaner_ for taking me on as a newbie partner with an unknown and untested ruleset.
